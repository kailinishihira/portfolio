        <h2>About</h2>
        <img src="img/kaili.jpg" alt="A photo of Kaili Nishihira" class="img-rounded">
        <p><span class="hawaiian">Aloha!</span> Born and raised on the island of Oahu, Hawai'i, Kaili spent her days enjoying island life and never dreamed of learning how to code or entering the tech world. Unhappy with her job opportunities and wanting to learn new skills, Kaili was inspired to learn how to code after reading an article written by an acquaintance detailing his journey to becoming a programmer. Kaili enjoys spending most of her time with her dog, Momo and partner, Scott. Kaili also enjoys traveling, cooking, and watching movies. Her interests include astrology and sewing. Kaili currently resides on Mercer Island, Washington.</p>
